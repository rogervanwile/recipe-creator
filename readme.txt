== Description ==

Our plugin provides you with a recipe block for the Gutenberg editor, with which you can easily insert recipes into your blog posts. You can edit the recipe directly in the editor. The recipe is automatically optimized in the background for search engines such as Google by adding structured data to the recipe in the background.

You can automatically insert a "Jump to recipe" block at the beginning of all blog posts so that your readers can easily jump to the recipe in your blog post. 

You can customize the design of the recipes to your blog. 

You can also ask your readers to share the recipe on Pinterest or tag you in their posts of the recipe on Instagram. If you use these functions, please refer to the privacy policies of Pinterest (https://help.pinterest.com/de/article/your-privacy-and-data-settings) and Instagram (https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy) on your privacy page.
